Practice performing SQL queries with multiple tables.

Create a database with a multiple tables and records. 

See the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the available entities and their relationships. 
NOTE: Remember that a many-to-many relationship requires a join table, 
so the entities in the diagram may be missing some actual tables. Explore the tables in your database.

For each of the following questions:
1. Write a comment that specifies which question you are answering. (SQL comments are two dashes, followed by text.)
2. Write the SQL query that answers the question, below that comment.

Get all customers and their addresses.
Get all orders and their line items.
Which warehouses have cheetos?
Which warehouses have diet pepsi?
Get the number of orders for each customer. NOTE: It is OK if those without orders are not included in results.
How many customers do we have?
How many products do we carry?
What is the total available on-hand quantity of diet pepsi?
